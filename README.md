## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to understand what customers from airline are saying about the brand. Then leverage on this information to advise the organization on areas of improvement and assist them in offering more value to their customers.
This project is subdivided into four sections including;
- Data mining
- Data preparation
- Data analysis
- Recommendations

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
  - BeautifulSoup
  - Requests
  - Pandas 
  - csv 
  - re
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## Data Mining
The inaugural stage of the analysis is web scrapping information from [this website](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways).
Additional metrics such as author, country, rating, overall_rating, date_published, type_of_traveller, seat_type, route and recommended were included to enrich the analysis.

## Data Preparation
The second step of data cleaning is the most important part of the analysis because as we all know 'garbage in, garbage out'
It entails removing elements in the dataset such as trailing spaces, unnecessary characters and proper handling of NULLs, to name a few, that would hinder the analysis. 

## Data Analysis
Once the data is sufficient, the next step is to deriver insights and patterns from the data that answer business questions such as;
- What are people saying about our brand?
- How would customers rate our services?
- Would they recommend our brand to others?

## Recommendations
From the findings we can then advise the organizations on areas of improvement.
